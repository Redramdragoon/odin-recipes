Hi I'm Jack
The first project as part of the Odin Project is to make a list of 3 recipes.
This will test my basic HTML skills
By the end of this section, I'd like to understand hamburger code, hopefully avoid the spaghetti altogether, I'm actually vegeterian IRL 
On a serious note, the actual process should help me understand the basics of HTML - how to use parantheses appropriately, use the <strong> and <em> commands for bold and italics respectively, and use the <ur> and <or> commands inconjuction with <li> to make ordered and unordered lists. The recipes themselves are quite irrelevant, it's how you code them in order, that is the key take away here. 
.. More to comment at the end of the project. 

Update October 15, 2024. 12:56 pm: 

As you can see the read me portion is kind of a mess. I am going to leave it for now to learn where mistakes were made so I can observe them and reference them later on. Obviously where I entered "<"strong">" for "bold" and <"em> for italiacs was taken into consideration in the code, so it's something to always be mindful of. 
I also noted errors when putting <"ur"> and <"or">, those were instead supposed to be "ul" and "ol" and I chalk that up to a novice programmer skill issue. 
In addition, the images took longer than anticipated, I was copy pasting one period when relative link insertion requires a double period. 
Other than some quick fix grammatical errors, I also learned the whole repo folder needs to be added in order for the project to work properly. 

Mainly for my own reference, but feel free to suggest edits to work if the coding doesn't meet standards. Obviously alt text as I understand is best practice, but for the sake of this project I have omitted those additions.
