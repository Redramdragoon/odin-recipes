Hi I'm Jack
The first project as part of the Odin Project is to make a list of 3 recipes.
This will test my basic HTML skills
By the end of this section, I'd like to understand hamburger code, hopefully avoid the spaghetti altogether, I'm actually vegeterian IRL 
On a serious note, the actual process should help me understand the basics of HTML - how to use parantheses appropriately, use the <strong> and <em> commands for bold and italics respectively, and use the <ur> and <or> commands inconjuction with <li> to make ordered and unordered lists. The recipes themselves are quite irrelevant, it's how you code them in order, that is the key take away here. 
.. More to comment at the end of the project.
